# Ecological-SDM-XGBoost
Machine learning–based ecological Species Distribution Modeling using XGBoost.

---

## Overview

This project develops an interpretable machine learning framework for predicting species presence/absence using environmental and spatial predictors. The model integrates climate, terrain, and soil variables to identify key ecological drivers influencing species distribution.

---

## Objectives

- Predict species presence/absence
- Evaluate environmental variable importance
- Improve model performance through feature selection
- Provide ecological interpretation of results

---

## Methodology

- Data preprocessing
- Feature importance screening
- Core vs. edge feature classification
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, F1, AUC, Log-loss)
